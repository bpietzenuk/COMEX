COMparative EXpression of transposable elements (COMEX)
=====

Purpose
---

Analysis of transcript amounts from transposable elements (TEs) using RNA-sequencing data. TEs are usually highly repetitive, which causes frequent multi-mapping of the short reads. In addition, RNA-sequencing reads may map to protein coding domains of closely related TE families, which may lead to false positive candidates for down-steam analyses. COMEX was designed to filter reads mapping across TE families, but retain reads mapping to a single TE family and then estimate TE transcript amounts using either uniquely or also multiply mapping reads.
